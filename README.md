# Firstcode
For the purpose of documenting previously done code and to assist others who intend to use this for academic purposes and improve on it if they so wish


The code files added may or may not be related to each other. They are intended to help others get a grip with concepts that the code covers
as these are the MATLAB files I have worked on while I learnt the methods. I am sure much improvement can be made.
I am much more comfortable with MATLAB as I have used it for much of my undergraduate studies, but I have recently taken up learning C++ and intend to have it as my go-to language
